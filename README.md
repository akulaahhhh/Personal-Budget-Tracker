# Personal Budget Tracker

A simple web application designed to help track personal finances.

## Purpose

This project was developed with the goal of enhancing my fundamental web development skills. Specifically, I focused on improving my ability to implement organized CSS and JavaScript in a professional manner. By learning these practices, I aim to build a strong foundation that will help me as I begin learning **React.js** in the near future.

## Upcoming Projects

Stay tuned for more projects to come as I continue to expand my skills and knowledge insyaallah!
